### Acknowledgement  
- [Kayla Woodbury](https://github.com/kaylawoodbury) for helping me understanding and working with CSS and especially helped me crack the nut about making the header go from transparent to filled when the user is scrolling. And also for being my pair programming partner, coding is best when done together!
